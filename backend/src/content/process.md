# Our Process

We follow a simple, proven process to deliver results for our clients.

## Step 1: Discovery Call

We start with a free 30-minute discovery call to understand your business, goals, and challenges. This helps us determine if we're a good fit for each other.

During the call, we'll discuss:
- Your current situation and pain points
- Your goals and objectives
- How we might be able to help
- Next steps if we decide to work together

## Step 2: Strategy & Proposal

After the discovery call, we create a detailed proposal that includes:
- Project scope and deliverables
- Timeline and milestones
- Investment breakdown
- Success metrics

We present this to you for review and discussion. We want to make sure we're aligned before moving forward.

## Step 3: Development

Once the proposal is approved, we begin the development phase. We use an agile approach with regular updates and feedback cycles.

You'll receive:
- Regular progress updates
- Access to staging environments
- Opportunity for feedback at each milestone
- Transparent communication throughout

## Step 4: Launch & Support

After development is complete, we launch your project and provide ongoing support. We don't disappear after launch - we're here for you long-term.

Our support includes:
- Launch assistance and monitoring
- Training and documentation
- Ongoing maintenance options
- Continuous improvement recommendations
